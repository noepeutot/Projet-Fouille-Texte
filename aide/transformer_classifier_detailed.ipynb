    "\n",
    "The most popular repository of pre-trained language models is the [HuggingFace model repository](https://huggingface.co/models). Currently (2023/01/23), it contains about 122,264 models contributed by the NLP community around the world. Some of the models are monolingual, i.e. pre-trained (and sometimes fine-tuned) on monolingual data only. Others are multilingual. You can search the repository with keywords, and you can filter the list of models with the criteria on the left panel: by task type, language, python library compatibility (PyTorch, Tensorflow, etc.) or by license type. To access the description of a specific model, click on the selected model in the model list to access its card (description) page.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next steps of this notebook, we will use a BERT model, specifically the monolingual, case-sensitive [`bert-base-cased`](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-cased) version of BERT, pre-trained on English data (self-supervision with a masked language modeling objective).\n",
    "\n",
    "To download the model, we need to provide the official name (identifier) of the model in the HF repository. You can find the exact name in the top-left corner of the model card page: it is the string followed by the copy-to-clipboard small icon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the model is downloaded only if there is no local copy that has been previously downloaded and cached on disk. When downloaded, the model is by default cached under the `.cache` subfolder in your home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in the cell below shows how to download a model from the HF hub and get 3 model-related objects:\n",
    "- the model configuration (`lmobject` in the code below) representing some important charcteristics of the model,\n",
    "- the model tokenizer (`lmtokenizer`); and\n",
    "- the language model itself (`lm`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The warning you get is normal and due to the use of the generic class AutoModel (you can get rid of the warning, please read the comments in the code for more details):"

Since the original model class is different from AutoModel, the transformers library throws a warning, informing us of the model layers or components that were ignored when the model was loaded.

That's fine, since we don't plan to train the model with an MLM objective: we just want to access its last hidden states, which are the contextual embeddings of the input text tokens.

Token sequences shorter than `max_len` are padded on the right with the special token `[PAD]` (whose id is `0` in this model) so that all texts in the batch end up with the same length. We also set argument `return_attention_mask` to True in order to get the attention mask vectors: these contain value 1 in the positions corresponding to real tokens in the original texts, and value 0 in all padded positions.

In that case, we might want to exclude the padding tokens from the pooling since they don't contribute to the meaning of the text.\n",

    "- Static (global) padding: padding all the examples at once, before starting training. Pros: each example is padded only once, for all the training epochs. Cons: ids and mask vectors have the max length (`max_input_len`) for all texts, including the many ones that are significantly shorter. This maximizes the number of padding positions, and hence results in a waste of memory and computation power.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dynamic (batch-wise) padding: the examples are padded during training, within every batch, to fit the longest example in the batch. Pros: shorter examples will not be padded to `max_input_len` if the longest example in the same batch is shorter than `max_input_len` (hence less waste of memory and computation power than in global padding). Cons: each example will be padded multiple times during training since the padding depends on the longest example in the batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similar-length batching (with dynamic padding): when building the batches, we ensure that examples grouped in the same batch have similar or comparable lengths. Pros: minimizes padding and therefore speeds up training. Cons: this strategy partially breaks the randomness of the order of training examples, which introduces a bias in the learning process and may sometimes decrease the classifier accuracy.\n",

    "Since our goal here is not to optimize computation, we will just follow the default strategy used in the Trainer object of the transformers library, which is batch-wise dynamic padding.\n"
